              About device allocation
            </h3>

            <p class="app-step-nav__paragraph">
              Each school has an allocation figure. This is the total number of devices they can order.
              There’s also a ‘cap’ figure for each school, which represents the number of devices they
              can order at any one time, to help manage stock levels.
            </p>

            <p class="app-step-nav__paragraph">
              Where a responsible body, for example an academy trust, orders on behalf of several
              schools, they’ll have a ‘shared’ cap.
            </p>

            <p class="app-step-nav__paragraph">
              For example, the responsible body may have an allocation of 100 devices across 4
              schools. To begin with, all 4 schools will show an allocation of 100 devices. If the
              responsible body then orders 25 devices for 1 school, all 4 will now show an allocation of 75.
